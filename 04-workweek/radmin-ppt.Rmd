# Background

## Engineering

* Knitting from RStudio IDE
    * RMD > [knitr] > MD > [Pandoc] > PowerPoint
* Pandoc now includes a PowerPoint translator
* Work completed by third party
* Supports general markdown capabilities (same things you would see in Beamer)
* PPT feature to be included in RStudio version 1.2

## Use cases

1. Create artifacts that will be customized (jumping off point)
2. Automate PowerPoint decks in RSC and send email to users (final product)

# Example

## What we do

  * Build and promote software that supports reproducible data analysis
  * Primary focus is the usability in our interfaces and APIâ€™s
  * Dedicated to R and open source software
  * 70% of our engineering effort is towards open source

## Who we are

  * Requires the top talent and minds to solve these problems
  * We created a structure to generate enough revenue to hire the them

## My experiences on-boarding R

## Who is the R Admin?

A data scientist (who knows R) and works with IT/Ops to: 

1. Establish R as an analytic standard
2. Promote R tooling
3. Integrate R into other systems.

# Demos

## Bitcoin ETL

```{r include=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
library(purrr)
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
```

### Extract

```{r eval=FALSE}
dat_json <- fromJSON("https://blockchain.info/ticker")
dat_df <- map_dfr(dat_json, c, .id="name")
```

### Transform

```{r eval=FALSE}
dat <- dat_df %>%
  mutate(timestamp = Sys.time()) %>%
  select(timestamp, name:symbol)
```

### Load

```{r eval=FALSE}
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "Postgres (DSN)")
dbWriteTable(con, "bitcoin", dat, append = TRUE)
```

## Bitcoin (ggplot)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
library(DBI)
library(dygraphs)
library(xts)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Connect
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), "Postgres (DSN)")
bitcoin <- tbl(con, "bitcoin")

# Tidy
dat <- bitcoin %>%
  filter(name == "USD") %>%
  select(timestamp, last, symbol) %>%
  collect
tseries <- xts(dat$last, dat$timestamp)
lab <- paste0("Bitcoin (", dat$symbol[1], ")")
ggplot(dat, aes(timestamp, last)) + geom_line()
```

## Bitcoin (dygraph)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
# Visualize
dygraph(tseries, main = lab) %>%
  dyOptions(axisLineWidth = 1.5, 
            fillGraph = TRUE, 
            drawGrid = FALSE, 
            colors = "steelblue", 
            axisLineColor = "darkgrey", 
            axisLabelFontSize = 15) %>%
  dyRangeSelector(fillColor = "lightsteelblue", strokeColor = "white")
```

## Bitcoin Exchange Rates (API)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=15, cache=TRUE, screenshot.opts=list(delay=5)}
knitr::include_app("http://54.149.163.100:3939/api/__swagger__/", height = "20px")
```

## Bitcoin Exchange Rates (App)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=15, cache=TRUE, screenshot.opts=list(delay=5)}
knitr::include_app("http://54.149.163.100:3939/content/26/", height = "20px")
