# Overview

Your PowerPoint slides can point viewers to live content on RStudio Connect. You will need to install webshot and PhantomJS:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("webshot")
webshot::install_phantomjs()
```

Then use `knitr::include_app('<URL>')` in an R code chunk. The render process will automatically take a screenshot of your app and link the image to your hosted app.

# Example

```{r cache=TRUE, screenshot.opts=list(delay=1), echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Click to open"}
knitr::include_app('http://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/content/831/')
```
